## üìç About this Professional Certificate

This repository showcases my projects completed as part of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**, a comprehensive 11-course program designed to equip you with in-demand skills for an entry-level data analyst role. 

Data analysis is essential for informed decision-making, and the demand for skilled data analysts continues to grow rapidly. Through this professional certificate, I gained the technical and soft skills necessary to analyze and present data using tools like **Excel**, **Python**, **SQL**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, and **Cognos Analytics**. The program also introduced the basics of **Generative AI** and its applications in data analysis.

The projects in this repository cover a variety of topics, including data cleaning, data visualization, predictive modeling, and working with APIs. Each project has helped me develop a strong portfolio to demonstrate my expertise in the field.
